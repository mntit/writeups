#fuzzing

There are many tools and methods to utilize for directory and parameter fuzzing/brute-forcing. In this module we will mainly focus on the [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) tool for web fuzzing, as it is one of the most common and reliable tools available for web fuzzing.

The following topics will be discussed:

- Fuzzing for directories
- Fuzzing for files and extensions
- Identifying hidden vhosts
- Fuzzing for PHP parameters
- Fuzzing for parameter values

Tools such as `ffuf` provide us with a handy automated way to fuzz the web application's individual components or a web page. This means, for example, that we use a list that is used to send requests to the webserver if the page with the name from our list exists on the webserver. If we get a response code 200, then we know that this page exists on the webserver, and we can look at it manually.

To install ffuf you can use "`apt install ffuf -y`" or download it and use it from its [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf.git)
and type `ffuf -h`

# Directory Fuzzing

As we can see from the example above, the main two options are `-w` for wordlists and `-u` for the URL. We can assign a wordlist to a keyword to refer to it where we want to fuzz. For example, we can pick our wordlist and assign the keyword `FUZZ` to it by adding `:FUZZ` after it:

```sh
ffuf -w wordlist -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ
```

Now, let's start our target in the question below and run our final command on it:

```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:FUZZ -u http://$target/FUZZ
```

We can even make it go faster if we are in a hurry by increasing the number of threads to 200, for example, with `-t 200`, but this is not recommended, especially when used on a remote site, as it may disrupt it, and cause a `Denial of Service`, or bring down your internet connection in severe cases. 

# Page Fuzzing

We now understand the basic use of `ffuf` through the utilization of wordlists and keywords. Next, we will learn how to locate pages.

## Extension Fuzzing

we will once again utilize web fuzzing to see if the directory contains any hidden pages. However, before we start, we must find out what types of pages the website uses, like `.html`, `.aspx`, `.php`, or something else.

One common way to identify that is by finding the server type through the HTTP response headers and guessing the extension. For example, if the server is `apache`, then it may be `.php`, or if it was `IIS`, then it could be `.asp` or `.aspx`, and so on. This method is not very practical, though. So, we will again utilize `ffuf` to fuzz the extension, similar to how we fuzzed for directories. Instead of placing the `FUZZ` keyword where the directory name would be, we would place it where the extension would be `.FUZZ`, and use a wordlist for common extensions. We can utilize the following wordlist in `SecLists` for extensions:

Now, we can rerun our command, carefully placing our `FUZZ` keyword where the extension would be after `index`:

```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://$target/indexFUZZ
```

## Page Fuzzing

We will now use the same concept of keywords we've been using with `ffuf`, use `.php` as the extension, place our `FUZZ` keyword where the filename should be, and use the same wordlist we used for fuzzing directories:

```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:FUZZ -u http://$target/FUZZ.php
```
